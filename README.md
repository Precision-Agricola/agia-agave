# Agia-agave

Utils and tools for IA applied to precision agriculture. Currently running experimentation on Agave, Pineapple, and Banana plants.

# Development Plan

Currently 

## AI PipeLine Setup

- Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (N/A)
- Pre-trained Models, re-train approach (N/A)
- Deep forest and documentation (4 days)

**Total days remaining: 4**
## Data Treatment

- Create Train/Test data (4-5 days)
- Data augmentation (1-2 day)
- Image acquisition (N/A)
- Image treatment (N/A)
    - Raw images
    - Orthomosaic
- Image enhancement (Report delivery)
- Post-Processing results
    - Region Properties and stats

### Deep Forest and AI implementations
